# Image Caption Generator

This repository contains a deep learning model designed to generate captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model takes an image as input and produces descriptive captions, as demonstrated in the examples below.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements:
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for extracting features from input images.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells for generating descriptive text sequences.
- **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet to improve feature extraction and model accuracy.

The model is trained on the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) and supports generating captions for various types of images.

## üöÄ Features

- Generates accurate and descriptive captions for diverse images.
- Handles complex scenes containing multiple objects.
- Supports training on custom datasets for specialized use cases.
- Visualizes training and validation loss for performance analysis.

## üìä Model Training Visualization

Below is an example plot of training and validation loss:

![Training Loss Plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bfa2e5e-5e3f-4ae4-8752-d72982bc30b1)

- **Blue Line**: Training loss.  
- **Orange Line**: Validation loss.  
The consistent downward trend indicates effective learning by the model.

## üì∑ Sample Caption Generation

### Example 1:
**Input Image**:  
![Traffic Light Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a30971f8-181e-494a-b36c-2058cf7aa9c7)  

**Generated Caption**: *"A traffic light with green, yellow, and red lights."*
